# Crypto Investment Tracker

I have found that I have several crypto investments that are based on different platforms for different reasons. Each platform has their own analytics based on my investments but they obviously do not allow you to congregate investments you may have on other platforms.

To alleviate this issue I wanted to create a single page app where you can congregate the information about all your various crypto investements and be able to track all the most important stats about each of those investments in a visual way. This app merges my love of financial markets and programming in one project.

The app allows you to group investments by coin type or just have every investment seperate and be able to view at a glance via various data visualisations how each investment is performing. The app also allows users to inspect further detail about each investment they have made.

There is a market view which gives some useful stats about the crypto market in general as well as displaying a table of the most up-to-date prices of most crypto-currencies one could have an interest in.

Finally, the app also has a section that has stats about the portfolio in general, essentially providing the broadest overview possible on a users portfolio as well as insights into the portfolio.

Data visualisation is a big part of this app that differentiates it from other crypto portfolio trackers. The visualsations are meant to be simple to understand and be able to provide the user with instant knowledge on how their investments are performing.
